            Every learner must carry a valid college identity card and hall ticket
            to the examination hall. Invigilators are authorized to verify the identity
            of learners at any time during the examination.
            <br><br>
            Entry into the examination hall without proper identification or after
            the scheduled reporting time may result in denial of entry or disciplinary action.

            Examinations are conducted as per the approved scheme, consisting of
            Internal Continuous Assessment and Semester End Examination.
            The duration of the semester-end examination is generally two and a half hours.
            <br><br>

            in aggregate as well as separately in the Internal Assessment and
            Semester End Examination components, wherever applicable.
            <br><br>
            Failure to meet the minimum passing criteria in any component
            results in the learner being declared unsuccessful in that course.

            Learners who do not satisfy the passing standards are permitted to appear
            for re-examinations conducted after the declaration of results.
            Re-examinations are held once in an academic year.
            <br><br>
            Submission of an online re-examination application along with payment
            of prescribed fees within the stipulated deadline is mandatory.

            Learners must maintain complete silence and discipline inside the
            examination hall. Any form of communication with other learners,
            use of unauthorized materials, or deviation from instructions
            issued by invigilators is strictly prohibited.
            <br><br>

            Learners must write answers only in the provided answer books and
            supplementary sheets. Writing names, roll numbers, symbols, or any
            identifying marks inside the answer book is not permitted.
            <br><br>
            Any insertion, removal, or tampering with answer books is treated

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-3">📈 Grading & Evaluation System</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The college follows a ten-point grading system for declaration of results,
            which includes calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) and
            Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).
            <br><br>
            Final results are declared only after successful completion of all
            examinations within the prescribed validity period of the program.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-3">⚠️ General Compliance</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Any act not explicitly mentioned in the rules but considered as misconduct
            by the examination authorities will be treated as a violation of
            examination regulations.
            <br><br>
            The college reserves the right to modify examination rules from
            time to time, and such modifications are binding on all learners.
