        Punishments & Disciplinary Actions
    </h1>
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-xl max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        Any violation of examination rules is treated as misconduct. Depending on
        the nature and severity of the offence, strict disciplinary action is
        initiated as per institutional examination regulations.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">📄 Possession of Unauthorized Material</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            If a learner is found in possession of chits, written notes, books,
            electronic devices, or any unauthorized material inside the examination hall,
            it is treated as a serious violation of examination conduct.
            <br><br>
            Such an offence usually results in annulment of the learner’s performance
            in the concerned examination and may attract further disciplinary action
            depending on the circumstances.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">✍️ Actual Copying During Examination</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Copying answers directly from unauthorized material or from another learner
            during the examination is considered a grave offence.
            <br><br>
            Learners involved in such malpractice are subject to cancellation of the
            examination attempt and may be debarred from appearing in subsequent
            examinations as decided by the examination authorities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Mutual or Mass Copying</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Mutual copying or mass copying involving two or more learners is treated
            as a collective act of misconduct.
            <br><br>
            In such cases, all learners involved may face annulment of their examination
            performance and exclusion from one or more future examinations depending
            on the extent of malpractice.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">📘 Tampering with Answer Books</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Smuggling answer books, inserting additional sheets, or writing answers
            outside the examination hall constitutes tampering.
            <br><br>
            Such offences are viewed very seriously and may result in exclusion
            from multiple examinations along with additional disciplinary measures.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">🖊️ Forgery & Document Manipulation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Forging invigilator signatures, altering official seals, or manipulating
            examination documents is considered an act of fraud.
            <br><br>
            Learners found guilty of such actions may face long-term exclusion from
            examinations and further institutional disciplinary proceedings.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">🚫 Impersonation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Appearing for an examination on behalf of another learner, or allowing
            someone else to appear, is classified as impersonation.
            <br><br>
            This offence can lead to cancellation of results and exclusion from
            several future examinations for all parties involved.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">💰 Bribery, Threats & Misconduct</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Attempting to bribe examination staff, use abusive language, or threaten
            invigilators and authorities is a serious breach of discipline.
            <br><br>
            Such behaviour may attract severe punishment, including suspension,
            exclusion from examinations, and institutional disciplinary action.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="punish-card p-6 bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">⚠️ Repeated or Severe Offences</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Learners committing repeated offences or engaging in severe forms of
            malpractice are liable for enhanced punishment.
            <br><br>
            The examination authorities reserve the right to impose stricter penalties,
            including long-term debarment, to protect the integrity of the examination system.
        </p>
